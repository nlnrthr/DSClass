# Getting and Cleaning Data Class
This is the course project for the getting and cleaning data class
The script run_analysis.r uses the UCI Human Activity Recognition Datasets
The data is in 2 subsets - a training and test subset. This script combines the 2 into a singledataset
cleans up column names to create a tidy dataset
Also using this tidy dataset, a new dataset is created with the means of each of the 561 variables in the dataset
for each subject and each activity
